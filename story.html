               <strong>The History of Jesus Christ</strong>

      Jesus Christ, central to Christianity, is a figure whose life
      and teachings have profoundly shaped religious and cultural 
      history. Born in Bethlehem around 4–6 BCE, He was raised in 
      Nazareth by Mary and Joseph in a devout Jewish household.

      Believed to be a descendant of King David, 
      Jesus fulfilled Jewish messianic prophecies.

      At the age of 30, after being baptized by John the Baptist, 
      Jesus began His ministry. For three years, He preached 
      messages of love, forgiveness, and the Kingdom of God, often
      using parables to convey profound moral lessons. During His
      ministry, Jesus performed miracles, healing the sick, feeding
      the hungry, and offering hope to the marginalized.

      His growing influence brought both devoted followers and
      fierce opposition from religious authorities. Betrayed by 
      Judas Iscariot and arrested by Roman officials, Jesus was 
      tried under Pontius Pilate and crucified at Golgotha around 30–33 CE.

      According to the Gospels, He rose from the dead three days later, 
      appearing to His disciples and ascending to heaven after 40 days. 
      His teachings—centered on compassion, justice, and humility—spread 
      through His apostles, forming the foundation of Christianity. 
      Today, Jesus is venerated as the Son of God by Christians, 
      regarded as a prophet in Islam, and revered globally as a profound moral teacher.
